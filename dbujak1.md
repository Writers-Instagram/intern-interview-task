# Talking Tissues

## Product Overview

Our latest product is, in simple words _a box of tissues_, equipped with a speaker.
Each time you take a tissue out, you hear a motivational slang quote.

## Target

**Talking Tissues** are targeted at basically every age group, from children to seniors.
The general idea is that everybody, no matter what age needs some motivation in their everyday life.

## Quotes

We are introducing several versions of the product, each with a different set of quotes depending on 
the **_country, language or age group_**. This are some of the quotes that our basic model
is equipped with:

>* Blow that nose playa!
* Yo dawg! Life is what you make of it!
* Clean them sinuses, playboy!
* Someone's got the sniffies!
* Tell your momma you love her!
* Step up your vitamic C game bro!


## Design

The concept was that **Talking Tissues** should be _elegant_ but at the same time simple.
If you haven't seen it yet, [this](https://image.ibb.co/bB5zEw/Bez_tytu_u.png) is what our
basic model looks like.

## Availability

The product itself is available for purchase in a few chain stores. Models destined for children

**Wernham Mifflin** stores.
